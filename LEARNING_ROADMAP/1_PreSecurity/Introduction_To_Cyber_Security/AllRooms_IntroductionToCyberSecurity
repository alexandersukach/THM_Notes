~~~~~~ Offensive Security Intro ~~~~~~

"To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."
- Offensive security involves using whatever method necessary to gain unauthorized access to a computer system
- The goal is to understand hacker tactics for the purpose of enhancing system defenses

A few potential careers:
Penetration Tester - tests tech products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities
Red Teamer - plays "adversary", attacking an organization and providing feedback on the security landscape
Security Engineer -  design, monitor, maintain security controls, networks, ect. to prevent cyberattacks


~~~~~~ Defensive Security Intro ~~~~~~

Defensive security is concened with 1. preventing intrusions from occuring, 2. detecting the intrusions, if 
they do happen to occur, and responding properly

Security Operations Center (SOC) - team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network to detect 
malicious activity (or gaps), such as vulnerabilities, policy violations, unauthorized activity, network intrustions, etc.

Threat intelligence - collects information to help company better prepare against adversaries, based on informed choices
that are relevant the the company itself

- Intelligence needs data to be collected, processed, and analyzes from credible sources to make informed decisions off of.

Digital Forensics - application of science to invesitage crimes and stablish facts based on computer systems
	 - Analyzees resources such as the file system, system memory, and different types of logs (system, network, etc.)

Incident - usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack

4 Incident Response Phases:
1. Preparation - team is ready/trained to handle incidents; security measures areput in place to prevent an incident in the first place
2. Detection/Analysis - having necessary resources to notice an incident, and also having the ability to classify the incident for better resolution
3. Containment/Eradication/Recovery - once incident identified: stop it from spreading, eliminate it, and resume secure operations
4. Post-Incident Activity - produce a report detailing the incident and reaffirm how to prevent such an incident from reoccuring

Malware analysis aims to learn about malicious programs in multiple manners: 
1. Static analysis - inspecting code without running it, which requires a good foundation in assembly language (the processor's instruction set)
2. Dynamic analysis - running the code in a controlled environment and observing the malware's behavior.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool - gathers security information/events from various sources and gathers in central location
