In computing, networks are simply connected technological devices, which can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions

The Internet is one giant network consisting of many, smaller networks within itself

ARPANET project - first iteration of the Internet (late 1960s), funded by the US Defense Dept. and first documented network

World Wide Web (WWW) - in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee creates the Internet as we know it today 

Internet Protocol (IP) address - used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time
	- this number is divided across four octets (0-255) and calculated through addressing/subnetting
	- IP addresses can move from device to device, but two separate devices may not simultaneously share the same address
	- Public address identifies a device on the Internet, while a private one identifies one amongst other devices

IPv6 created due to the shortage of available IPv4 addresses

Media Access Control (MAC) address - the network interface of a device (the microchip board found in the motherboard) is assigned
	a unique address (12 character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by colons)
	- The first 6 characters represent the company that manufactured the interface, and the last six make up a unique number
	- MAC addresses cannot be spoofed (Technically, they can be but let's not pay attention to that)
	- Many public networks tend to keep track of MAC addresses as opposed to IP's, considering the former are more reliable

Ping command uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices and its existence


* MAC is physical identifier, IP is logical identifier *
