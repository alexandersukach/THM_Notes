====INTRODUCING LAN TOPOPLOGIES====

Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies:
STAR - devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub

		D

	    D - S - D
		|
		D
- more expensive, yet scalable in nature
- more devices means more maintenance, which could make troubleshooting harder
- prone to failure if centralized device fails (thankfully, they're often robust)

BUS - connection relies on a a single connection, known as a backbone cable

	D	D	D
        |	|	|
       O-----------------O
	   |	   |
	   D       D
- prone to slowness/bottlenecks if devices are simultaneously requesting data
- one of the easier and more cost-efficient due to lack of cabling/dedicated networking equiptment
- little redundancy, as there is only a single point of failure

RING (token) - devices are connected directly to each other to form a loop; less cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardward such as with a STAR 

		- D -
	      /       \
	     D        D
	      \       /
	        - D -	

- data sent across the loop until desine device is reached
- easy to troubleshoot since data travels only one wak
- less prone to bottleneck since large amounts of traffic aren't travelling across network at any one time


Switch - dedicated device within a network designed to aggregate multiple other devices (network-capable) using ethernet
	- More efficient than hubs/repeaters
	- Keep track of what devices are connected to which port
	- Reduces network traffic by not repeating a packet to every port, and only sending to intended target

Router - connects networks and passes data between them
	- useful when devices are connected by many paths



====A PRIMER ON SUBNETTING====

Subnetting - splitting network into smaller, miniature networks within itself Ex., business departments having different networks

- Achieved by splitting up number of hosts than can fit within a network, represented by a number called a subnet mask (same 4 octet concept as IP address

Subnets use IP addresses to identify network address, host address, and default gateway

Network address - identifies the start of the actual network and used to identify a network's existence
	Ex. IP address 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0

Host address - IP address here identifies a devince on the subnet (Ex. 192.168.1.100)

Default gateway - special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another detwork
	- Any data that needs to go to a device not on the same network is sent to this device first
	- Any host address can be used, but usually its the first or last in the network (.1 or .254), Ex. 192.168.1.254




====ARP====

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network
	- associates a MAC address with an IP address; each device3 on a network keeps a log of MAC addresses associated with the other devices

ARP request is sent, sending a broadcast on the network of devices asking "What's the MAC address of IP _"
ARP reply, of the MAC address, is returned only by the device owning that IP address
The requesting device can now store this information in its ARP cache for future use




====DHCP====

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - automates IP address assignment, eliminating the need for manual, physical entry into a device 

A device on a network that hasn't been assigned an IP address, sends out a DHCP Discover request to determine if any DHCP servers are on the network
The DHCP server replies with a DHCP offer, containing the IP address that can be used.
The device confirms it would like this address by sending a DHCP Request to the server.
The server sends an acknowledgement back, DHCP ACK, to recognize this assignment has occurred
