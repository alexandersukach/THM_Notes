====What is the OSI Model====

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model - provides a framework explaining how data is handled across a network; consists of 7 layers:
	1. Physical, 2. Data Link, 3. Network, 4. Transport, 5. Session, 6. Presentation, 7. Application
	- Specific  processes take place at each layer, adding pieces of information that, combined, "complete" the data (encapsulation)

====Layer 1 - Physical====
- Physical components of the hardware; devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other (1's and 0's)
- Information is contained in the form of bits, which are transmitted at a controlled rate from one node to the next
- Ex. hubs, repeaters, modems, cables


====Layer 2 - Data Link====
- Physical addressing of the transmission:
	1. Receives packet from network layer, including IP address for the remote computer
		Packets are divided into frames based on NIC frame size
	2. Adds MAC addressof the receiving endpoint
- Ultimately responsible for error-free data transfer from node to node
Ex. switches and bridges


====Layer 3 - Network====
- Routing and re-assembly of data takes place on this level (using the most optimal path)
	Protocols: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
- Layer works for data transmission from one host to the other located in different networks
- Everything is dealt with IP addresses, which are placed in the packet header (sender and receiver)
- Ex. switches and routers


====Layer 4 - Transport====
- Ensures reliable communication between two hosts
- Protocols used:
	TCP - constant connection between two devices for data to be fully sent/received (error checking is incorporated into its design)
	UDP - much faster than TCP and more flexible, as it doesn't require a continuous connection

- TCP is used if ALL data must be accurate and complete
- UDP is used for small data, where full transmission isn't necessary (Ex. video streaming, where quality is in question)


====Layer 5 - Session====
- Responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions between devices
- "Checkpoints" provide synchronization points in the data, helping identify errors so data can be resynced (only newest pieces of data are sent)


====Layer 6 - Presentation====
- Also known as the Translation Layer; standardization occurs here, as all data must be handled in the same way, no matter how the software works
- Data is translated from one format to another another; consider two people using different email clients, yet the emails should go through the same


====Layer 7 - Application====
- Protocols and rules are in place to determine how users should interact with sent/received data
- Ex. GUI's, DNS, etc


GeeksForGeeks Brief (Too lazy to actually write out the names) Layers:
7 - applications create the data
6 - data is formatted and encrypted
5 - connections are established and managed
4 - data is broken into segments for reliable delivery
3 - segments are packaged into packets and roputed
2 - packets are framed and sent to the next device
1 - frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically
